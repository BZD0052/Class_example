*Helps in distribution of reproducible pipelines, and anyone can reproduce your analysis with one click.* 
*Helps to make websites and presentations and even write manuscripts.*

knitr, rmarkdown and pandoc.Pandoc is a universal document converter, in our case, it goes from:Rmarkdown => markdown => document
We also need to have LaTex installed in order to reder pdf documents. i.e. TinyTex.
